    <hr />
    <pre>
Baby seals, with their big eyes and soft fur, charm everyone who sees
them. Born on icy shores, they quickly adapt to the cold. Their early days
are filled with learning to swim and bonding with their mothers. These
experiences help them navigate the challenges of life in the ocean.
