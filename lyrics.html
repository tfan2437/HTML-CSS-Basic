    I get a feelin' sometimes
    That I can't get close enough to you
    I feel it most in the nighttime
    Even though that's when I'm closest to you
    If I could be under your skin
    Closer than we've ever been
    We'd be closer than we've ever been, oh
    
    Mm, I feel it most in the nighttime, yeah
    Me never on your timeline, yeah
    See you always in the limelight
    Keep me rollin' in the deep, yeah
    Not a tease, no joke, I do mean it
    Don't cease, baby don't, why you floatin'?
    Wanna lock you up in my sight
    But you run away like fish, yeah
    
    I keep you right next to me (to me)
    Only just in my dream (in my dream)
    I see you in red, blue, green (oh, no)
    Don't wake me up from sleep
    I think I'm losin' my grip (my grip)
    Everything off the beam
    Why you showed up in my life
    Like this so sudden, oh God, no
    
    I get a feelin' sometimes
    That I can't get close enough to you
    I feel it most in the nighttime
    Even though that's when I'm closest to you
    If I could be under your skin
    Closer than we've ever been (uh-huh)
    We'd be closer than we've ever been (uh-huh)
    
    Come holla at a youngin from the block, baby, uh
    Say the time don't wait for nobody
    Oh, I bet you thought, baby (oh, I bet you thought baby, oh)
    But the time gon' stop
    When you and I make our lips lock baby (oh-oh-oh, trust me)
    And once again you made me
    Misplace my pride, baby (oh-oh-oh, so trust me, oh-oh)
   
    Promised myself never again
    But you got me doing the same thing all over again
    And I make her body
    Di-di-diddy-diddy-bop
    Di-di-diddy-diddy-bop (di-di-diddy-diddy, di-di-diddy-diddy)
    I wanna show you how I gets down
    Baby, girl, come on (come on and oh-oh-oh-oh)
    
    Please, leave your message after the beat
    
    If love ain't for us (if love ain't for us)
    이걸로 만족할게 (이걸로 만족할게)
    I don't need your touch (I don't need your touch)
    너의 사랑이면 돼 (너의 사랑이면 돼)
    (Come closer, come closer, yeah-yeah, yeah)
    
    Yeah
    If this is all we can do (can do)
    Yeah, just lookin' at you (at you)
    There's gon' be no take two
    Stay where you are
    If this is all we can do (can do)
    Yeah, just lookin' at you (at you)
    There's gon' be no take two
    Stay where you are
    
    Stay where you are
    Just stay where you are (stay where you are)
    Stay where you are
    Stay where you are
    Just stay where you are
    Stay where you are, oh
